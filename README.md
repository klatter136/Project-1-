<h1>Designing Scalable Web Application Architectures</h1>



<h2>Project Description</h2>




For this project, I will design an architecture for a scalable web application. I will create two versions of the design: one using traditional server scaling (both vertical and horizontal) and another leveraging serverless technologies. This will illustrate the practical applications of load balancing, API gateways, and different scaling strategies in real-world scenarios.


<h2>Part 1: Traditional Server Scaling Design</h2>

Here is a high-level architecture diagram for a traditional web application.


For the database layer, vertical scaling would be done by upgrading to a larger instance type with more CPU, memory, and storage throughput. This makes the database faster and able to handle more queries and connections without requiring major changes to the application. The trade-off is that while this approach is simple and effective, there is a ceiling to how large an instance can get, and costs rise quickly as you move up in size.

For the web and application tiers, horizontal scaling is the better strategy. This involves running multiple servers in Auto Scaling Groups behind load balancers, which distribute incoming traffic evenly. The scaling happens automatically based on metrics like CPU utilization, request count, or response time, so the application can adapt to spikes in traffic. To make this work smoothly, user sessions need to be stored in a shared place such as a cache or database, rather than on a single instance, so that any server can handle a request consistently.

Overall, vertical scaling is the simplest way to gain quick performance improvements, but it comes with cost and growth limitations. Horizontal scaling is more complex to design and manage, but it provides greater flexibility, resiliency, and efficiency at scale. Vertical scaling is useful for short-term boosts, while horizontal scaling is the long-term solution for a truly scalable application.

<h2>Part 2: Serverless Architecture Design</h2>

Here is a high-level architecture diagram for a serverless web application.


With serverless, the cloud provider basically takes care of scaling for you. Services like AWS Lambda automatically spin up more capacity when traffic goes up and scale back down when it’s quiet, so you don’t have to mess with servers or scaling rules. You also don’t need to pre-allocate resources — your code only uses compute and storage when it actually runs. Monitoring is built in through tools like CloudWatch and X-Ray, so you can see performance, errors, and usage without wiring up a bunch of extra systems.

The way it scales is very different from running your own servers. Costs are pay-as-you-go, which means you only pay for what’s used instead of keeping instances online all the time. Ops overhead is way lower since there’s no patching or infrastructure management. In theory, it can scale almost infinitely, though there are still limits like function timeouts and concurrency caps. One thing to watch out for is “cold starts,” where a Lambda might take a moment to warm up if it hasn’t been used recently, but that can be smoothed out with features like provisioned concurrency.

Overall, serverless makes life easier by cutting out most of the heavy lifting around infrastructure, keeping costs tied to actual usage, and letting developers spend more time on building features instead of running servers.

<h2>Part 3: Comparison and Analysis</h2>

Traditional scaling works well for steady, predictable workloads where you can provision servers and databases to match demand. It offers consistent performance and more control over latency, but it requires managing infrastructure, patching, and manual scaling decisions. Serverless, by contrast, automatically adjusts to traffic spikes and variable loads, making it ideal for bursty or unpredictable usage patterns. Costs are usage-based, which is efficient at low or irregular traffic levels, though at very high, constant volume, a traditional model with reserved or savings-plan instances can often be more cost-effective. Development and deployment are simpler with serverless since there are no servers to manage, though you need to account for service limits and potential cold starts. Overall, traditional scaling is better for high, stable workloads that demand predictable performance and fine-grained control, while serverless is a strong fit for new apps, spiky workloads, or smaller teams looking to minimize operational overhead.
